# Basic Python Projects

Welcome to **Basic Python Projects** — a collection of simple, beginner-friendly Python modules and exercises.  
These projects are designed to help new programmers build a solid foundation in Python programming through practical examples.

## About

These projects are ones I have personally taught to students at the institution where I work. They cover fundamental concepts such as:

- Variables and data types  
- Input and output  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Loops (`while`)  
- Lists and basic data structures  
- Simple games like Rock-Paper-Scissors  

All code is **open source** and free to use, modify, and share.

## Getting Started

To run any project/module:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SpyrosThan/Basic_Python
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd basic-python-projects
    ```

3. Run the Python file you want to try:
    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```

Make sure you have Python installed. These projects are compatible with Python 3.x.
